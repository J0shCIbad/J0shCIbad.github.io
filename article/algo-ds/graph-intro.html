		<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		<p>Graph and network algorithms constitute an essential category of
		algorithms upon which a great many modern technologies depend on. 
		With graphs and networks being the primary data structure used to
		represent relationships and connections between entities, they are
		used to model or computationally represent concrete objects like 
		circuits, routes, computer networks, artificial neural networks,
		and even tasks. 
		<br/><br/>
		The algorithms designed to operate on these data
		structures define how accurate and efficient machines will be able to
		route vehicles, handle logistics, plan or schedule tasks, establish
		optimal assignment of workers to positions. Even the internet itself
		depends on graph algorithms, be it for TCP/IP routing protocols which
		facilitates network communication, or for assigning clients to internet
		service provider servers to accomodate the vast number of users needing
		to establish connection to the internet.
