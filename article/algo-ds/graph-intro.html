		<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		
		<p>Graph and network algorithms constitute an essential category of
		algorithms upon which a great many modern technologies depend on.
		With graphs and networks being the primary data structure used to
		represent relationships and connections between entities, they are
		used to provide computational abstractions to concrete objects like
		circuits, routes, computer networks, artificial neural networks,
		and even sets of tasks.</p>
		
		<p>The algorithms designed to operate on these data structures determine
		how accurately and efficiently machines are able to route vehicles, 
		handle logistics, plan or schedule tasks, and establish optimal
		assignment of workers to positions. Even the internet itself depends on
		graph algorithms, be it for TCP/IP routing protocols which facilitates
		network communication, or for assigning clients to internet service
		provider servers to accomodate the vast number of users needing to
		establish connection to the internet.</p>

		<h2>What is a Graph?</h2>
		
		<p>A graph is a set of entities known as <b>vertices</b> or <b>nodes</b>
		connected by a set of lines called <b>edges</b>. These sets may be denoted
		by sets <em>V</em> and <em>E</em> respectively, and the graph may be
		defined as graph <em>G = (V, E)</em>.</p>
		
		<p>A vertex <em>v</em> is <b>adjacent</b> to a vertex <em>w</em> if they
		are connected by an edge <em>e</em>. Both vertices <em>v</em> and <em>w</em>
		are said to be <b>incident</b> to edge <em>e</em> by which they are connected.
		A vertex's neighbours are all the vertices adjacent to it, while its <b>degree
		</b> is the number of neighbours that it has. In a graph where edges have
		direction (directed graph) a vertex's <b>out-degree</b> is defined as the
		quantity of edges flowing away from the vertex to it's neighbours, while it's
		<b>in-degree</b> is the quantity of edges flowing towards the vertex from its
		neighbours. The vertex's degree is a sum of its out-degree and in-degree.</p>
		
		<p>An edge <em>e</em> is represented by the pair of vertices it is incident on
		<em>(v, w)</em>. In an <b>undirected graph</b>, edges have no direction and 
		the ordering of the pair is insignificant. However, in a <b>directed graph</b>,
		the edges, known as <b>directed edges</b>, have direction making the ordering
		of the vertex pair important. An edge may or may not be <b>weighted</b>, that
		is, to have an associated <b>weight</b> or <b>cost</b> <em>c<sub>e</sub>
		</em>. The graphs containing these edges may also be descibed as weighted or
		unweighted.</p>
		
		<p>An edge incident on the same vertex is called a <b>loop</b> and a vertex may
		share <b>multiple edges</b> with a neighbouring vertex. A graph is said to be a
		<b>simple graph</b> if it is unweighted, undirected, has no loops, and has no
		multiple edges. A simple graph allowing multiple edges is called a <b>multigraph
		</b>. Most of the time, the term "graph" denotes a simple graph unless
		otherwise stated. </p>
