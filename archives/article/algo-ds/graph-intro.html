		<h2>Introduction:</h2>
		
		<p>Graph and network algorithms constitute an essential category of
		algorithms upon which a great many modern technologies depend on.
		With graphs and networks being the primary data structure used to
		represent relationships and connections between entities, they are
		used to provide computational abstractions to concrete objects like
		circuits, routes, computer networks, artificial neural networks,
		and even sets of tasks.</p>
		
		<p>The algorithms designed to operate on these data structures determine
		how accurately and efficiently machines are able to route vehicles, 
		handle logistics, plan or schedule tasks, and establish optimal
		assignment of workers to positions. Even the internet itself depends on
		graph algorithms, be it for TCP/IP routing protocols which facilitates
		network communication, or for assigning clients to internet service
		provider servers to accomodate the vast number of users needing to
		establish connection to the internet.</p>

		<h2>What is a Graph?</h2>
		
		<p>A graph is a set of entities known as <b>vertices</b> or <b>nodes</b>
		connected by a set of lines called <b>edges</b> (also known as <b>links</b>
		or <b>arcs</b>). These sets may be denoted by sets <em>V</em> and <em>E</em>
		respectively, and the graph may be defined as graph <em>G = (V, E)</em>.</p>
		
		<h3>Components of a Graph</h3>
		
		<p>A vertex <em>v</em> is <b>adjacent</b> to a vertex <em>w</em> if they
		are connected by an edge <em>e</em>. Both vertices <em>v</em> and <em>w</em>
		are said to be <b>incident</b> to the edge <em>e</em> by which they are connected.
		A vertex's neighbours are all the vertices adjacent to it, while its <b>degree
		</b> is the number of neighbours that it has. In a graph where edges have
		direction (directed graph) a vertex's <b>out-degree</b> is defined as the
		quantity of edges flowing away from the vertex to it's neighbours, while it's
		<b>in-degree</b> is the quantity of edges flowing towards the vertex from its
		neighbours. The vertex's degree in this case is the sum of its out-degree and
		in-degree.</p>
		
		<p>An edge <em>e</em> is represented by the pair of vertices it is incident on
		<em>(v, w)</em>. In an <b>undirected graph</b>, edges have no direction and 
		the ordering of the pair is insignificant. However, in a <b>directed graph</b>,
		the edges, known as <b>directed edges</b>, have direction making the ordering
		of the vertex pair important. An edge may or may not be <b>weighted</b>, that
		is, to have an associated <b>weight</b> or <b>cost</b> <em>c<sub>e</sub>
		</em>. The graphs containing these edges may also be descibed as weighted or
		unweighted.</p>
		
		<p>An edge incident on the same vertex is called a <b>loop</b> and a vertex may
		share <b>multiple edges</b> with a neighbouring vertex. A graph is said to be a
		<b>simple graph</b> if it is unweighted, undirected, has no loops, and has no
		multiple edges. A simple graph allowing multiple edges is called a <b>multigraph
		</b>. Most of the time, the term "graph" denotes a simple graph unless
		otherwise stated. </p>
		
		<h3>Walks and Circuits</h3>
		
		<p>A <b> walk</b> is a series of edges joining a series of vertices, in which
		edges and vertices may repeat. It is often denoted by it's <b>vertex sequence
		</b> <em>(v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub>, ..., v<sub>n</sub>)</em>.
		A <b>trail</b> is a walk with no duplicate edges, while a <b>path</b>
		is a trail with no duplicate vertices. Sometimes, path's are given the same
		definition as a trail (walk w/o duplicate edges, but w/ duplicate vertices). In
		such a case, a path with no duplicate vertices is referred to as a <b>simple
		path</b>. The length of walk, trail, or path is the number of edges in the walk.
		They may be <b>directed</b> if their edges are directed (have direction). If the
		walk, trail, or path has no starting nor ending vertex <em>(..., v<sub>n-1</sub>,
		v<sub>n</sub>, v<sub>n+1</sub>, ...)</em>, then it is <b>infinite</b>. If the
		walk has no start vertex but has an end vertex <em>(v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>,
		v<sub>3</sub>, ...)</em>, then it is <b>semi-infinite</b>. A semi-infinite
		simple path is called a <b>ray</b>.</p>
		
		<p>When the first and last vertex of a walk is distinct, then the walk is
		<b>open</b>. When they are the same, then the walk is <b>closed</b>. A 
		<b>circuit</b> is a closed trail, while a <b>cycle</b> or <b>simple
		circuit</b> is a closed simple path. Similar to walks, trails, and paths,
		circuits may be directed if their edges are directed.</p>
		
		<p>In graph theory, there are various special types of walks and circuits that are
		worth noting. In 1736, Leonhard Euler solved the Konigsberg Bridge problem, laying
		the very foundations of graph theory. At the time, Konigsberg had seven bridges
		connecting two islands to each other and to the mainland. The Konigsberg Bridge
		problem is the problem of walking through all bridges once, without repeats.
		Reimagined as a graph with the bridges acting as edges, the problem can be restated
		as whether or not there exists an <b>Eulerian trail</b> or <b>Eulerian path</b>
		in this graph. An Eulerian trail is a trail that visits every edge. Euler realized
		that such a trail only exists in a graph if there is either zero vertices of odd
		degree, or two vertices of odd degree. Likewise, an <b>Eulerian circuit</b> or 
		<b>Eulerian cycle</b> is an Eulerian trail which starts and ends on the same vertex,
		and only exists if the graph has absolutely no vertices of odd degree.</p>
		
		<p>A little over a century later, William Rowan Hamilton proposed the Icosian game.
		The object of the game is to find a circuit that visits every vertex of a dodecahedron.
		When the dodecahedron is flattened out into a two-dimensional graph, the problem can
		be restated as that of finding a <b>Hamiltonian circuit</b> or <b>Hamiltonian cycle</b>
		in this graph. A Hamiltonian circuit is a circuit which touches every vertex in the graph.
		When the start and end vertices are distinct, the path is called a <b>Hamiltonian
		path</b> or a <b>traceable path</b>. No theorem exists to prove the existence of a
		Hamiltonian path or circuit in a generic graph, though some theorems exists to answer
		this question under specific conditions. These theorems are not discussed here and is
		left for the reader to research further.</p>
		
		<h3>Connectivity</h3>
		
		<p>As mentioned earlier, a graph with directed edges is known as a a directed graph,
		or <b>digraph</b>, otherwise it is an undirected graph. An undirected graph is 
		<b>connected</b> if there exists a path from every vertex to all other vertices in the
		graph. For directed graphs, if there is a directed path between every vertex in both
		directions, the directed graph is <b>strongly connected</b>. If a directed graph is
		connected when direction is ignored (as if it was an undirected graph), then it is
		<b>weakly connected</b>. Note that a strongly connected graph is weakly connected as
		well. In contrast to connect graphs, a <b>disconnected</b> is one where at least
		two vertices are not connected by any edges.</p>
		
		<p>A graph is <b>dense</b> if the number of edges is close to maximum, usually
		of quadratic order |<em>E</em>| &#8712; O( |<em>V</em>|<sup>2</sup> ). A dense graph
		is <b>complete</b> if every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex in the graph. In
		a complete graph, |<em>E</em>| = |<em>V</em>| * (|<em>V</em>|-1) / 2. In contrast,
		a graph is <b>sparse</b> if the number of edges is close to minimum, usually of linear
		order |<em>E</em>| &#8712; O( |<em>V</em>| ). Sparse graphs may be disconnected.</p>
		
		<h3>Types of Graphs and Subgraphs</h3>
		
		<p>Graphs may 
		
		<h3>Cuts, Partitions, and Matchings</h3>
		
		<p>Graphs may be split up into disjoint sets of vertices. This partitioning is called a
		<b>cut</b> and is denoted as cut <em>C = (S, T)</em>. When cutting a graph, any edges
		that connect the disjoin partitions is said to be <b>crossing</b> the cut, and is a
		member of the <b>cut-set</b>. 
		
		Some graphs may be split up into two sets of vertices, such that in each set, no two
		vertices are adjacent. This <b>cut</b> or <b>partition</b> can be denoted as cut <em>C
		= (S,T)</em> such that <em>S</em> and <em>T</em> are disjoint subsets of a graph's 
		vertex set. 
		
		, and the resultant graph is called a <b>bipartite graph</b> (as it can
		be partitioned into two disjoint sets of vertices).</p>
